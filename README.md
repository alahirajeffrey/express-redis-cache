### Requirements

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) is the world’s fastest in-memory database. It provides cloud and on-prem solutions for caching, vector search, and NoSQL databases that seamlessly fit into any tech stack—making it simple for digital customers to build, scale, and deploy the fast apps our world runs on.
